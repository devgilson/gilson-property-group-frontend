                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    At The Gilson Group, we donâ€™t just manage propertiesâ€”we elevate them. With a deep-rooted passion for real estate, business, and technology, we understand how modern consumers engage with brands in the digital age.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our journey began in 2020, when founder Joshua Gilson Burton transformed his expertise in the music industry, corporate business, and retail into a thriving real estate venture. What started as a family fix-and-flip project in Lansing, Michigan, has grown into a diverse portfolio of high-performing short-term, mid-term, and long-term rentals across Michigan and Colorado.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our expansion into the Colorado Rockies was a game-changer. Acquiring a 40-acre ranch in Fairplay allowed us to establish a strong foothold in the market, applying strategic marketing and operational expertise to drive growth. Today, with a headquarters in downtown Breckenridge, a global team, and over $35 million in assets under management, we are a trusted partner for property owners across Summit, Park, and beyond.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What sets us apart? We donâ€™t just manage propertiesâ€”we invest in them. By treating every home as if it were our own, we provide unmatched care, strategic marketing, and revenue optimization to help our clients maximize their returns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you own a luxury mountain retreat or a city-based rental, The Gilson Group is here to help you unlock the full potential of your investment.
